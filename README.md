# Land-Type-Classification-Sentinel-2-Satellite-Images
Land Type Classification uses Deep Neural Networks to analyze Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for classifying land cover types (agriculture, water, urban, desert, roads, forests). Led by Eng. Fayad and Eng. Mostafa, this project supports urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management applications.
